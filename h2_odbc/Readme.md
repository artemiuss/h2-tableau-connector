A H2 ODBC connector. 
This database does not come with its own ODBC driver at this time, but it supports the PostgreSQL network protocol. Therefore, the PostgreSQL ODBC driver can be used. 
Support for the PostgreSQL network protocol is quite new and should be viewed as experimental. It should not be used for production applications.
